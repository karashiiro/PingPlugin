             * We might be able to read these from the game itself, but
             * I'm tired of maintaining struct offsets that change every
             * patch. If you know of a function that simply returns the
             * currently-connected IP address, feel free to PR!
             *
             * Historical notes:
             * Previously, I used the Windows TCP connection table to get
             * these, but for some reason this doesn't work in Wine or
             * CrossOver, or with gaming VPNs since these manipulate TCP
             * connections. To get around this, I used a game function that
             * sets the Sending/Receiving data in-game to get a struct that
             * had a value of roughly (2 x ping RTT), but this was annoying
             * to maintain and was also horribly inaccurate.
             *
             * Historical notes (updated):
             * I re-added support for reading the Windows TCP connection table,
             * but I'm keeping this function in order to fall back when
             * accessing the TCP table fails.
